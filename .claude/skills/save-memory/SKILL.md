# Save Memory

Distill the current session's work into **durable knowledge** under `.claude/memory/`, so the
next session (and newcomers) can catch up. This is the **write** pass — not a raw log, but
distilled *meaning*.

All files are written in **English** (see `conventions/english-only-artifacts.md`).

## Principles
- Save only what is **valuable weeks from now**. Skip trivial steps.
- 1 file = 1 fact. Kebab-case names, small files.
- `decisions/` is **append-only** — if a decision changes, add a new file; do not edit the old one.
- Every change → update one line in `MEMORY.md`.

## Procedure (in order)

### 1. Review the session
Ask: what did this session *decide*, *learn*, *leave unfinished*? Use the conversation plus
`git status` / `git log` to know which files were touched.

### 2. Decisions — `decisions/NNNN-slug.md`
For each **architecture/design decision with a rationale**, create a new file (incrementing
number):
```markdown
---
name: NNNN-slug
description: <one line>
metadata: { type: decision, date: <YYYY-MM-DD> }
---
<decision>
**Why:** <rationale>
**How to apply:** <how>. Related: [[other-memory]].
```
Only create one when it is genuinely a decision — not every change needs an ADR.

### 3. Conventions / gotchas — `conventions/slug.md`
New conventions or gotchas encountered (e.g. a font bug, a syntax that causes a bug). Same
frontmatter format with `type: convention`.

### 4. HANDOFF.md — OVERWRITE
Update the latest WIP state with the six sections: Current goal / Done / In progress—Next /
Settled decisions / **Context to Load (paths only)** / Blocked. This is what the next session
reads first — write it so anyone grasps "where we are, what's next" in 10 seconds.

### 5. sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md — APPEND
A short session summary: Done / Decisions / Remaining. If today's file already exists, append
to it.

### 6. Update MEMORY.md
Add/edit one index line per new decision/convention. Keep the index compact and grouped.

## After finishing
Briefly report to the user what was saved (how many decisions, conventions, whether HANDOFF
was updated). Do NOT commit unless the user asks — only write files.

## Verify
- `MEMORY.md` links to every file just created (no broken links).
- `HANDOFF.md`'s "Context to Load" contains only real, existing paths.
